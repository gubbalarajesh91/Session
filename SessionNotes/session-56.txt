if there is a code chage, should I go for build or not?

code and configuration

what is configuration?
db urls, db usernames, passwords, api endpoint, other system urls.

keep the key inside code, but value should be out of the code.

if changes, change the value and restart the application.

2. Node Port
3. Load Balancer

NodePort --> 
internet --> external
intranet --> inside

Load Balancer
