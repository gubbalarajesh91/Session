Volumes in Kubernetes
--------------------------
1. external HD
	SSD, Pendrive, etc.
2. Google/Microsoft drive

EBS/EFS

1. HD should be as near as possible to the computer.
2. Google drive, can be anywhere in the world. Network is used for file sharing. NFS . Network File sharing

1. Static Provisioning
2. Dynamic Provisioning

Static Provisioning
--------------------------

EBS
-----------
Mumbai --> Region

North mumbai --> AZ-1a
South mumbai --> AZ-1b


1. I need to create the EBS volume
2. You need to install the drivers. I have to install EBS related drivers in EKS cluster.
kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/?ref=release-1.32"
3. Your nodes should have access to connect with EBS volumes. Attach EBSCSI policy to the EC2 instance role.

wrappers...

You can represent EBS volume inside kubernetes with a resource called Persistant Volume. This is equivalant to EBS storage inside kubernetes cluster...

PVC --> Persistant volume claim. Pods should claim I want the volume. Pods can claim through resource called PVC.

1. If your PV is not available
-----
check drivers installed or not
check your ec2 have the role and permission

if instances are creted in 1a, 1b and 1c and volume is in 1c.

 1. Admins
 2. Users
 
as a application devops engineer, I will get access to expense namespace.

1. users send email to storage team for creation of volume. AWS storage team will create volume and give you ID.
2. users send email to k8 admin to create pv for them with the ID.
3. user can claim using PVC.

Dynamic Provisioning
---------------------
1. You need to install the drivers. I have to install EBS related drivers in EKS cluster.
kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/?ref=release-1.32"
2. Your nodes should have access to connect with EBS volumes. Attach EBSCSI policy to the EC2 instance role.
3. someone on behalf of you should create volume and equivalant PV automatically --> dynamic provisioning that one is storage class.

so admins create sc for every project as best practice.

Static
---------
kid --> Mother --> Father --> Money
Pod --> PVC    --> PV     --> Storage/Volume

Dynamic
---------
kid --> Mother --> E-Wallets --> Money
Pod --> PVC    --> Storage Class --> Storage



EFS --> Elastic File system
---------------------------
EBS vs EFS
------------
1. EBS is like hard disk, volume and instance should be in same AZ-1a
2. EFS is through NFS protocol, it can be anywhere
3. EBS volume is static, it can increase on its own.
4. EFS is completely dynamic in storage, it can automatically expand memory
5. Which is suitable for DB applications like MySQL. EBS because of less latency

application is in mumbai , database is in US
