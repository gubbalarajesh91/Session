without CI
-------------
there will be one linux server

build and release team
----------------------
clone the code
install node js
run npm install
create a zip file
upload the zip file to nexus through nexus API

1week after, once development completed then they will inform

many issues, inform developers, again they will work....


again QA, UAT and
PROD
------------
12hr deployment window
24hr monitoring
1week monitoring for other defects

no testing, unit testing
unit testing is about testing the functions, which are basic blocks of programming. Only developers has to do unit testing...

coding standars --> dev, qa, uat
Static source code analysis --> scan the code, give some recommendations
you must apply the recommendations to pass the build

SAST --> security related things, analysis will be given to developers they have to fix

DAST --> dynamic security

Open source libraries scan --> libraries scan.. frequently upgrade the libraries

docker image scan --> 

now deploy the code to development

then perform functional testing, developers can take care...

integration testing --> test the entire functionality. this will be performed by QA

sonar scanner
sonar cli
sonar agent
