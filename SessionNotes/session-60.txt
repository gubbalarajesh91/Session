1. PV --> representing physical storage
2. PVC --> Claiming the storage
3. SC --> automatic creation of volume and PV based on the claim from PVC

Deployment vs Statefulset
---------------------------
1. stateful applications like DB
2. PV and PVC are mandatory for statefulset
3. Orderly provisioning of pods happens.
4. pods keep their identity like name.
5. We must create headless service.
6. every pod should have its own storage. so PV and PVC should be created for every pod.


1. Install EBS drivers
2. Check EC2 Role permissions
3. create storage class
4. create statefulset

mysql-mysql-0

pvc-name-statefulset-name-0

if deployment, nslookup of service gives, service IP address
if statefulset, nslookup of headless service gives us IP address of all pods.


HELM
--------------
1. building image
2. running image

only few values frequently change in manifest files.

1. kubernetes package manager
2. templatise manifest files

1. Chart.yaml

install hellm chart

helm install <preferred-name> . --> . represents Chart.yaml in current directory

helm uninstall nginx

helm upgrade nginx .

helm status

helm history
